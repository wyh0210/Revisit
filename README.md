# Assignment 3 - Replicating a Classic Experiment

by: Andrew Kerekon, Aviv Nur, Bijesh Shrestha, Yihan Wang

## Description

This research conducts a scientific investigation to discover the best successful data visualization strategies using a controlled experiment. As a scientist performing this study, our objective is to compare four visualization formats utilizing a custom-designed experimental setup. The experiment, which is based on the methodology of Cleveland and McGill (1984) and Heer and Bostock (2010), entails developing support code for experiment management, data/stimuli production, error computation, and results documentation, all of which are carried out using simple JavaScript interfaces. The project's goal, with at least ten participants, is to undertake a complete study of the acquired data to determine which visualization method best helps data comprehension. Furthermore, the study is open to going beyond typical visualization methods, such as investigating alternative approaches to data presentation. This endeavor aims to give empirical evidence to the field of data visualization while also encouraging innovation in visual data representation strategies.

## Hypothesis
1. Participants will make more accurate measurements with the vertical bar chart than the stacked bar chart.
2. Participants will make more accurate measurements with the vertical bar chart than the bubble chart.
3. Participants will make the least accurate measurements with the bubble chart.
4. Participants will make similarly accurate measurements with the bubble chart and the pack circle chart.

## Results

Table 1. Accuracy by Chart Type with Bootstrapped 95% CI
